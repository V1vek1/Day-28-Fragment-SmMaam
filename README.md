In this App i used to learned about Fragment.

Fragment is not a Activity but it works on Activity. 
Fragment is like a piece of activity UI (User Interface).
For a Fragment , we Create a xml or Backend both file if its need.

Fragments can't exist on their own. They require activity or other fragments.
Fragments have their own lifecycle and receive their own input events.
You can add or remove fragments while the containing activity is running.
The Android fragment lifecycle is affected by the activity lifecycle.
The onStop() method is called when the fragment is removed from the host activity or the host activity has been stopped.



This is Main Screen (Activity) of this App, The Clock, date , Validate are buttons, That is used for open the Fragments :-
